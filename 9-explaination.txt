Here
We take input from user.
We take those values in a list.
We create another list by literally reversing it.
We equate them and judge if the number is palindrome or not.


Trials - 11
Forgot:
 - splitting a integer converted to string in a list.


Learned - New with Leetcode's interface as i created the code on VS code as a normal input one and faced a bit of a problem with interchanging both.
